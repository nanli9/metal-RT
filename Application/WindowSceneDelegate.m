/// Configures the app's window property and attaches it to a scene.

/// - Parameters:
///   - scene: A scene that's connecting to the app.
///   - session: A session instance that has the configuration details for `scene`.
///   - options: Additional options for configuring the scene, such as when a person
///   selects a quick action.
///
/// This method is an opportunity for the app to configure the `window` property
/// and attach it to the `scene` argument.
/// If the app has a storyboard, UIKit automatically configures the
/// `window` property and attaches it to `scene` before calling this method.
///
/// > Note: The `scene` and `session` arguments might not be new instances
/// > (see `application:configurationForConnectingSceneSession`).

/// - Parameter scene: A scene that UIKit is disconnecting from the app.

/// This method is an opportunity for the app to release any resources that it
/// associates with `scene` that it can recreate if UIKit reconnects the scene.
///
/// > Note: UIKit can reconnect a scene unless it discards the scene's sessions
